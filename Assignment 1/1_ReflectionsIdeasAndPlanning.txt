1.) One student's survey came with the idea for an app that allows students to discuss classes with other students who have or are currently taking said class. This reminds me a bit 
of "Rate My Professor" but for classes instead of instructors. I think an app that forces students to leave more thorough/helpful reviews could be useful for other students. 

2.) An app developer could occasionally push out a message politely asking for a donation from the user if they are enjoying the app. Besides charging or using ads, I can't think of any
other ways a developer could feasibly "reap the rewards" of their work so to speak. 

3.) In my opinion, the various Google apps have good UI/UX. The UI is simple and clean and doesn't distract the user with superfluous icons or information.
As for UX, Google has many different apps that exist within its ecosystem. With a Google account, a user can easily access many different apps for all their needs. 

4.) Discussing survey results with other classmates has given me a few more ideas for a possible project for this course. I particularly liked the idea of a course discusion/review app, 
as well as an app for identifying bugs in a house.
